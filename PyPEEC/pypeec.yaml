# logging options
LOGGING_OPTIONS:
    LEVEL: "DEBUG"  # logging level for the handlers
    INDENTATION: 4  # indentation level for the blocks
    COLOR: false  # use (or not) colors for the logs
    CL_DEBUG: '[38;5;247m' # terminal color code
    CL_INFO: '[38;5;15m' # terminal color code
    CL_WARNING: '[38;5;202m' # terminal color code
    CL_ERROR: '[38;5;196m' # terminal color code
    CL_CRITICAL: '[38;5;196m' # terminal color code
    CL_RESET: '[0m' # terminal color code

# FFT options
FFT_OPTIONS:
    #   - NumPy is not very fast
    #   - SciPy is typically faster than NumPy
    #   - FFTW is typically faster but has to be installed separately
    SOLVER: "SciPy"  # "NumPy" or "SciPy" or "FFTW"

    # FFT handlin
    #   - if true, then the FFT is done separately for each dimension
    #   - if false, then the FFT is done at once for the complete tensor
    SPLIT_TENSOR: false  # split (or not) the tensors for the FFT

    # FFT library options
    FFTS_WORKER: null  # number of workers for SciPy (None for default)
    FFTW_THREAD: 4  # used for FFTW (number of threads, 1 for no multi-threading)
    FFTW_CACHE_TIMEOUT: 100  # used for FFTW (cache timeout in seconds)
    FFTW_BYTE_ALIGN: 16  # used for FFTW (size for byte alignment)

# matrix factorization options
#   - SuperLU is typically slower but integrated with SciPy
#   - UMFPACK is typically faster but has to be installed separately
MATRIX_FACTORIZATION: "SuperLU"  # "SuperLU" or "UMFPACK"

# method for dense matrix multiplication
#   - FFT for doing the multiplication with circulant tensors and FFT
#   - DIRECT for standard matrix multiplication (extremely slow and memory intensive)
MATRIX_MULTIPLICATION: "FFT"  # "FFT" or "DIRECT"
