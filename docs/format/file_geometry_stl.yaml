    # definition of the voxel structure
    #   - d: array with the voxel dimensions (x, y, and z directions)
    #   - xyz_min: array with the lower corner coordinates of the voxel structure
    #       - vector with the x, y, and z coordinates
    #       - if null, the STL mesh bounds are used
    #   - xyz_max: array with the upper corner coordinates of the voxel structure
    #       - vector with the x, y, and z coordinates
    #       - if null, the STL mesh bounds are used
    #   - check: boolean parameters for checking the STL mesh integrity
    #       - if true, the STL mesh should represent a closed surface
    #       - if false, the surface status of the STL mesh is not checked
    #   - tol: distance between the voxel boundaries and the voxelization test points
    #       - if non-zero, a clearance is respected between the test points and the voxel boundary
    #       - if equal to zero, test points can be located on the voxel boundary
    #   - thr: threshold for the voxelization (in order to keep/exclude voxels)
    #       - the fraction of test points located inside the shape is computed for each voxel
    #       - if the fraction is greater than the threshold, the voxel is added to the structure
    #   - pts: number of test points used for the voxelization (for each voxel)
    #       - if greater than one, several points are used (pts^3 points are created)
    #       - if one, a single test point is used (in the center the voxel)
