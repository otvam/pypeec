PyPEEC Workflow
---------------

.. figure:: ../images/workflow.png

   Description of the PyPEEC workflow (mesher, viewer, solver, and plotter).
   The input files (geometry, problem, tolerance, plotter, and viewer) are either in JSON or YAML formats.
   The output files (voxel and solution) are either in JSON or Pickle formats.

PyPEEC Tools
------------

* **mesher**

  * Create the voxel structure
  * Import the geometry from voxel files
  * Import the geometry from STL files
  * Create the geometry with stacked PNG files
  * Draw the geometry with stacked 2D vector shapes
  * Assign different domain names to the voxels
  * Resampling (refine) the voxel structure
  * Construct the graph of the structure and detect connected components

* **viewer**

  * Visualization of the different domains composing the voxel structure
  * Visualization of the connected components composing the voxel structure
  * Comparison of the voxelized and original geometries

* **solver**

  * Computation of the incidence matrix
  * Computation of the Green and coupling tensors
  * Computation of the resistance, inductance, and potential matrices
  * Computation of the electric-magnetic coupling matrices
  * Creation of the equation system
  * Extraction of a sparse pre-conditioner
  * Extraction of a matrix-vector linear operator for the full system
  * Check the condition number of the system
  * Solve the equation system with the pre-conditioner and the linear operator
  * Extract the solution (terminal voltages and currents, scalar fields, and vector fields)

* **plotter**

  * Plot the material description (materials and sources)
  * Plot the scalar and vector fields of the different voxels
  * Plot the magnetic field generated by the voxels
  * Plot the solver convergence and residuum

Entry Points and Scripts
------------------------

The entry points of the different tools are located in the ``pypeec.main`` module:

* Running the tools with files as input/ouput:

  * ``run_mesher_file`` for running the **mesher**
  * ``run_viewer_file`` for running the **viewer**
  * ``run_solver_file`` for running the **solver**
  * ``run_plotter_file`` for running the **plotter**

* Running the tools with data as input/ouput:

  * ``run_mesher_data`` for running the **mesher**
  * ``run_viewer_data`` for running the **viewer**
  * ``run_solver_data`` for running the **solver**
  * ``run_plotter_data`` for running the **plotter**

Additionally, a command line tool is located in the ``pypeec.script`` module:

* ``pypeec --help`` for displaying the command line options
* ``pypeec --version`` for displaying the version number
* ``pypeec mesher`` for running the **mesher**
* ``pypeec viewer`` for running the **viewer**
* ``pypeec solver`` for running the **solver**
* ``pypeec plotter`` for running the **plotter**
* ``pypeec examples`` for extracting the **examples**
* ``pypeec documentation`` for extracting the **documentation**
* ``pypeec config`` for extracting the **default config file**

Input/Output File Description
-----------------------------

The following input files (JSON or YAML format) are used:

* ``file_geometry`` (JSON or YAML, input/configuration file): description of the geometry
* ``file_problem`` (JSON or YAML, input/configuration file): description of the magnetic problem
* ``file_tolerance`` (JSON or YAML, input/configuration file): description of the solver numerical options
* ``file_viewer`` (JSON or YAML, input/configuration file): options for the plots generated by the viewer
* ``file_plotter`` (JSON or YAML, input/configuration file): options for the plots generated by the plotter

The following files (JSON or Pickle format) are generated:

* ``file_voxel`` (JSON or Pickle, output/data file): file with the definition of the voxel structure
* ``file_solution`` (JSON or Pickle, output/data file): file with the solution of the magnetic problem
