Technical Details
=================

Dependencies
------------

**PyPEEC** is entirely programmed in **Python 3** and has the following dependencies:

* PyYAML (configuration file format)
* NumPy, SciPy, and Joblib (numerical libraries)
* Pillow (for the mesher, image manipulation)
* Shapely and Rasterio (for the mesher, 2D shape manipulation)
* VTK and PyVista (for the mesher, 3D shape manipulation)

Additionally, the following **libraries** are used for the **plotter** and **viewer**:

* Matplotlib and PyQt5 (2D plots)
* VTK, PyVista, PyVistaQt, and PyQt5 (3D plots)

The following **optional packages** can be used for speeding up the solver:

* PyAMG
* UMFPACK (available through SciKits)
* MKL/PARDISO (available through Pydiso)
* FFTW (available through pyFFTW)
* CuPy (using GPUs through CUDA)

Supported Platforms
-------------------

The main **target platform** of PyPEEC is **Linux** on x86/x64:

* Linux / RedHat 7.9 on x86/x64
* Linux / Ubuntu 20.04 on x86/x64
* Linux / Ubuntu 22.04 on x86/x64

The following **platforms** and systems have been  **partially tested**:

* Apple / macOS Monterey 12 on x86/x64
* Apple / macOS Ventura 13 on M1 Pro
* MS Windows / Pro 10 on x86/x64

The following **GPUs** have been tested:

* GPU / NVIDIA RTX 2070 Max-Q
* GPU / NVIDIA T4 Tensor
* GPU / NVIDIA Tesla K80

The following **platforms** are passing the **automated tests**:

* Linux / Ubuntu 22.04 on x86/x64
* Microsoft / Windows Server 2022 on x86/x64
* Apple / macOS Monterey 12 on x86/x64

If you deploy PyPEEC on computing nodes, the GUI libraries (Matplotlib, PyVistaQt, PyQt5) are not required.
Inside Jupyter notebooks, IPyWidgets and Trame are used for the rendering.

Configuration File
------------------

* The default configuration file is ``pypeec/data/config.yaml``.

    * This file is always loaded first.
    * This file is included in the package.

* The default configuration file can be extracted with the ``pypeec config`` command.

* The filename located the environment variable ``PYPEEC`` is loaded.

    * If the variable is not set, the default configuration is kept.
    * If the variable is is set, the default configuration is replaced.
    * This file can be in JSON or YAML formats.

Packaging and Environment
-------------------------

* A Python package can be built from the ``pyproject.toml`` and ``setup.cfg`` files.
* The shell script ``run_build.sh`` is used to build the Python package.
* The shell script ``run_release.sh`` is used to a create release.
* In order to create a minimal Python Virtual Environment, use ``requirements.txt``.
* In order to create a minimal Conda Environment, use ``conda_base.yaml``.
* In order to create a development environment, use ``conda_dev.yaml``.

Automated Tests
---------------

* The tests are located in the ``tests`` folder (using the ``unittest`` framework).
* The shell script ``run_tests.sh`` is used to run the tests.
* The tests are checking that the examples are running correctly.
* Only integration tests currently exist (no unit tests).

Sphinx Documentation
--------------------

* The documentation is located in the ``docs`` folder (using the ``sphinx`` generator).
* The shell script ``run_build.sh`` is used to build the HTML documentation.

Contributing
------------

PyPEEC is welcoming contributions (code, documentation, example, benchmark, test, tutorial, etc.) !
For large changes, please first discuss the change you wish to make in the issue tracker.

Bug report
