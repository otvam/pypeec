# Summary

The partial element equivalent circuit method (PEEC) is a particularly 
interesting integral-equation method for electromagnetic problems as it can be 
easily combined with circuit simulations and does not require a discretization 
of the free space. This paper introduces PyPEEC, an open-source Python solver 
targeting 3D quasi-magnetostatic problems such as inductors, transformers, 
chokes, IPT coils, or busbars. The geometry is described with voxels and the 
solver uses an FFT-accelerated variant of the PEEC method. The FFT acceleration 
drastically reduces the computational costs and the memory footprint.

# Statement of Need

Quasi-magnetostatic field simulations are widely used for the design and 
optimization of electrical components (e.g., power electronics, packaging, IC 
design). Among the existing numerical methods (e.g., FEM, FDTD, PEEC, BEM), the 
PEEC method features several advantages [@method_review; @ruehli; @volume_peec;
@peec_book]:

- Only the active materials are discretized (no need to mesh the vacuum/air).
- Intuitive understanding of the equation discretization process.
- Straightforward connection of external circuit elements.

The fundamental drawback of the classical PEEC method is that the matrix 
describing the equation system is not sparse. This means that the computational 
cost and the memory requirement become problematic for large problems.

This problem can be mitigated if the geometry is represented with voxels 
[@fft_peec; @yucel]. The first advantage of such geometries is that the Green's 
functions (i.e. the inductance and potential matrices) have analytical 
solutions, avoiding computationally intensive numerical integrals [@hoer_exact; 
@piatek_exact]. The second advantage is that, due to the regular voxel 
discretization, many coefficients of the inductance and potential matrices are 
redundant. The dense matrices are block-Toeplitz Toeplitz-block matrices and 
feature the following key properties [@fft_multi_solver; @fft_multi_theory]:

- The block-Toeplitz Toeplitz-block matrices can be embedded into circulant 
tensors reducing the memory requirements from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$.
- The matrix-vector multiplications can be done with Fourier transforms. With 
an FFT algorithm, the computational complexity of matrix-vector multiplications 
is reduced from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n \log(n))$. 

Different variants of the FFT-accelerated PEEC method have been shown to be 
extremely fast for a large variety of electromagnetic problems such as 
high-frequency transformers [@fft_peec], power inductors [@marconato], human 
body field exposure [@human_peec], nuclear fusion devices [@bettini], and PCB 
layouts [@grossner].

An open-source implementation ("FFT-PEEC") of the FFT-accelerated PEEC method 
already exists [@peec_code; @nlie_code]. However, this code can only handle 
magnetic materials for static simulations (and not in the frequency domain). 
Moreover, depending on the considered quasi-static problem (e.g. geometries 
with multiple conductors), the source code requires some adaptations. The 
open-source tools "VoxHenry" and "MARIE" are also used FFT-accelerated methods 
but are specialized for full-wave solutions without magnetic materials 
[@vox_code; @marie_code]. Finally, it should be noted that all the 
aforementioned implementations depend on proprietary programming languages and 
libraries.

PyPEEC, the tool introduced in this paper, addresses these needs by providing a 
3D quasi-magnetostatic implementation of the FFT-accelerated PEEC method 
[@fft_peec]. PyPEEC is a fully open-source (MPL\ 2.0 licence and implemented in 
Python) and offers a general-purpose solver by allowing the description of 
arbitrary problems without having to modify the source code.

# Capabilities and Workflow

In this paper, the release 5.7 of PyPEEC is considered. PyPEEC solves 3D 
magnetostatic and quasi-magnetostatic problems with voxel geometries. An 
arbitrary number of conductive domains, magnetic domains (ideal and/or lossy), 
and sources (voltage and/or current) can be used. The current density, flux 
density, electric potential, magnetic potential, and loss density are computed. 
The free space magnetic field (near-field) can also be computed on a point cloud. 
Additionally, the voltage, current, complex power, and impedance of the 
different terminals are extracted.

*plotter*](workflow.pdf){#fig:workflow width="100%"}

PyPEEC is implemented in pure Python using NumPy, SciPy, Joblib, Rasterio, 
Shapely, Pillow, Matplotlib, and PyVista. The solver is able to leverage 
multi-core CPUs and GPUs. Optional HPC libraries are available for accelerating 
the sparse preconditioner factorization (MKL/PARDISO and PyAMG) and the FFT 
operations (FFTW, MKL/FFT, and CuPy/CUDA). PyPEEC can be used through an API, a 
command-line tool, or Jupyter notebooks. The package is available through the
Python package index (PyPi) and the community-driven packaging for Conda
(conda-forge). A Docker image with JupyterLab is also maintained. 

\autoref{fig:workflow} depicts the PyPEEC workflow. First the *mesher* builds 
the geometry (from vector shapes, STL files, PNG files, or GERBER files), 
performs the voxelization, and checks the validity of the discretization. 
Afterward, the *solver* creates the FFT-multiplication operators, assembles the 
equation systems, extract sparse preconditioners, solves the problem, and 
post-processes the solution. The *viewer* and the *plotter* are used to 
visualize the results. Aternatively, ParaView can be used to analyze and 
visualize the solutions.

# Solver Performance

To demonstrate the performance of the solver, a planar air-core spiral inductor 
is considered [@shape_optim]. The inductor has a footprint of 4\ mm^2^ and is 
operated in the 40.68\ MHz ISM band. \autoref{fig:performance} shows the ratio 
between the AC and DC current densities, the relative error on the extracted 
impedance, and the computational cost. The number of degrees of freedom 
represents the number of unknowns for the PEEC problem (dense equation system). 
The computational cost is evaluated with an AMD\ EPYC\ 7543\ CPU (without GPUs).

width="100%"}

As the skin depth is smaller than the dimension of the conductor, the eddy 
currents are non-negligible. This implies that, with a coarse discretization, 
the resistance value is less accurate than the inductance value. With a 
tolerance of 4%, the quasi-static problem is solved in 4 seconds. The FFT 
acceleration allows dense PEEC problems with 10^7^ degrees of freedom to be 
solved in 80 seconds.

The performances of PyPEEC are impacted by the following factors. For
problems dominated by eddy-currents and/or containing magnetic materials,
the majority of the computational effort (typically over 70%) is linked
to the FFT accelerated multiplications. In such cases, the performances
are directly driven by the FFT solver and benefits from the available
parallel and GPU algorithms. Finally, it should be noted that PyPEEC is
using a regular voxel structure to represent the geometry. This implies
that large geometries with small features cannot be meshed efficiently.
