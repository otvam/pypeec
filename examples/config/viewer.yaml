# PyPEEC options for the viewer renderings.
#
# A plot is described with a dictionary with the following fields:
#   - framework: framework used for the rendering ("pyvista" or "matplotlib")
#   - layout: string describing the plot type (see description below)
#   - data_window: dictionary describing the plot window
#   - data_options: dictionary describing the plot options
#   - data_plot: dictionary describing the plot content
#
# For the viewer, the following types of plots are available:
#
#   - "domain": plot the different domains composing the voxel structures
#       - title: title located at the corner of the plot (null for hiding)
#       - colormap: colormap used to plot the different voxel groups
#       - opacity: opacity of the face color
#
#   - "graph": plot the connections between the voxels
#       - title: title located at the corner of the plot (null for hiding)
#       - colormap: colormap used to plot the different voxel groups
#       - opacity: opacity of the face color
#
#   - "mesh": plot the deviation between the voxelized and reference geometries
#       - title: title located at the corner of the plot (null for hiding)
#       - color_voxel: face color for the voxelized structure
#       - color_reference: face color for the reference structure
#       - opacity_voxel: face opacity for the voxelized structure
#       - opacity_reference: face opacity for the reference structure
